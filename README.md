# Bug Catcher Game
This project is a simple interactive game where the player tries to catch a randomly hopping bug by clicking on it. The game gets progressively harder as the bug speeds up over time, making it more challenging to catch.

# How It Works
## Bug Movement:

The bug hops randomly across the game area at regular intervals.
Each time the player clicks on the bug, the score increases by 1, and the bug‚Äôs hopping interval decreases, making it move faster.
## Reset Speed:

If the bug becomes too fast to catch, the player can click the "Reset Speed" button to restore the original hopping interval.
## Reset Score:

The player can also click the "Reset Score" button to start fresh by setting the score back to 0.
# Features
Increasing Difficulty: With every successful click, the bug speeds up, adding a layer of challenge.
Reset Options: Players can reset either the speed or the score at any point.
Interactive Gameplay: Simple point-and-click mechanics make the game easy to play but hard to master!
